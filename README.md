## 1. Install dependencies

> Run `yarn` or `npm install`

## 2. Run server

> Run `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`

## 3. How to use?

> Controllers in `/src/package/YOURPACKAGE/controller` have been registered automatically, `/src/package/user/controller/index.js` is a template file which shows the usage of the controller.  
> The filename will be the path for the router and crud methods are already set by default.
> BaseControllerMethods are defined in file `/src/baseController.js`
> All you need to do is just to copy package `user` and rename it. Edit the model file.

## 4. Authorization

> `JWT` is injected into `app.js`, set as a `middleware`, and `use` before `router`.  
> Edit `config/tokenExceptUrl.js` to configure whether API can skip the authorization approval

## 5. Database

> In this starter template, we use `MongoDB` and `Mongoose`, since the `strict mode` is set to default by `Mongoose`, you'll need to set the option(`strict: false`) in model file to make it more flexible(PS: That depends on you by the way)  
> The controller we defined uses `...ctx.request.body` to parse `SQL` query.

## 6. RESTful API

> We use `HttpMethod` to define what `SQL` method should use.

#### `GET` method will have two API by default:

> `/` means get all resources  
> `/:id` means get one by id, basically the `_id` generated by `MongoDB`

#### Depends on the request param, `Delete` method can do a multiple delete and singal delete

> Both `?id=xxx` or `?id=xxx&id=yyy` works
